## Overview

This an exercise from the Git and Github Bootcamp course I'm taking through Udemy. The course is instructed by Colt Steele. This is the closing exercise (lesson # 71) from Section 8: Comparing Changes with Git Diff.

### The challenge

This exercise came with a starter repo that needed to be cloned down to my machine. The exercise was working with two bands: Queen and Fleetwood Mac and their various lineups over the years.
The exercise has two parts:

- Part One: Setup

First - Clone the repository for the exercise.

Second - Change into the required folder and verify that I was on the correct branch.

Third - Run the git switch command to change branches

Fourth - Verify that there are two branches and each  branch contains two files.

- Part Two: The Diffs

-1: Compare the difference between the two branches across all files

-2: Compare the difference between the two branches but only for a specific file.

-3: Switch branches and run a diff to compare the current HEAD to the previous commit.

-4: While on this branch, change the queen.txt file by replacing Adam Lambert with your own name. Save the change.  Add queen.txt to the staging area. Do not commit.

-5: Edit the fleetwoodmac.txt file, changing the lead singer from Stevie Nicks to Stevie Chicks.  Save the file, but do not stage it.

-6: Run a diff that would reveal the unstaged changes in the working directory.

-7: Run a diff that would reveal only the staged changes.

-8: Run a diff that prints all changes since the prior commit.

### Built with

- Using VSCode
- BASH Terminal

### What I learned

- Reading diffs
- View the unstaged changes
- View the Working Directory Changes
- View staged changes
- Diff specific files
- Compare changes across branches
- Compare changes across commits

### Continued development

There are 20 sections to this course, each with a number of lessons and exercises. This is the final exercise from Section 8. There are pervious exercises that I will be posting, as well as exercises that I have done since this one which I will also add. I am more than halfway through this course at this time and not every section has an exercise that could be, or needs to be added to a repository. I will add those exercises that are relevant as it will help solidify my understanding and better develop my skill through practice.
